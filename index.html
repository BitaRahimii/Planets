         There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.
         The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover
           Perseverance
           landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets 
         are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
         Beyond Neptune  a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign 
         including longtime favorite Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered
          beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets 
         exo means "from outside.
         The key difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is the kinds of objects that share its orbit
          around the Sun. Pluto, for example, has not cleared its orbit of similar objects while Earth or 
          Jupiter have no similarly sized worlds on the same path around the Sun.

            The key difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is the kinds of objects that share its orbit around the Sun. Pluto, for example, has not cleared its orbit of similar objects while Earth or Jupiter have no similarly-sized worlds on the same path around the Sun. Like planets, dwarf planets are generally round (Haumea looks like an overinflated football) and orbit the Sun.
            There are likely thousands of dwarf planets waiting to be discovered beyond Neptune. The five best-known dwarf planets are Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris. Except for Ceres, which lies in the main asteroid belt, these small worlds are located in the Kuiper Belt. They’re considered dwarfs because they are massive, round, and orbit the Sun, but haven't cleared their orbital
            path.

            A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk.
             Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion.
             The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large volumes
             of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth
             's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's
              surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving
               tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.

         In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is.
          The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while 
         others talk of a "plurality of worlds". 
         Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts.
